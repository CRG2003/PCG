An assignment piece for the module "procedural content generation" in which I was tasked to create a scene procedurally within the unreal engine with the given theme "monster factory". 

A chose to create a damaged city as the scene for a potential large monster attack which included procedurally modelled buildings made using houdini and other procedural methods within unreal to place things like rubble around the scene.

Module grade : 64 / 100
